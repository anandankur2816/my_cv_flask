        <h3> Python Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was in 1st year of my college as I wanted to make my own video game based on a crow chasing an ant that I played in my childhood. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience in programming and developing mobile and web applications.</p>
